## WHAT IS CREATIVE COMPUTING ?什麼是創意計算？

Creative computing is about creativity. Computer science and computing-related fields have long been introduced to young people in a way that is disconnected from their interests and values – emphasizing technical detail over creative potential. Creative computing supports the development of personal connections to computing, by drawing upon creativity, imagination, and interests.

創意計算與創造力有關。計算機科學和計算機相關領域一直以一種與他們的興趣和價值觀念脫節的方式向年輕人介紹 - 強調技術細節而非創造性潛力。創意計算通過利用創造力，想像力和興趣來支持與計算機的個人連接的發展。

Creative computing is about empowerment. Many young people with access to computers participate as consumers, rather than designers or creators. Creative computing emphasizes the knowledge, practices, and fundamental literacies that young people need to create the types of dynamic and interactive computational media that they enjoy in their daily lives.

創意計算與授權有關。許多可以訪問計算機的年輕人作為消費者參與，而不是設計師或創作者。創意計算強調年輕人需要創建他們在日常生活中享受的動態和交互式計算媒體類型的知識，實踐和基礎知識。    

Creative computing is about computing. Engaging in the creation of computational artifacts prepares young people for more than careers as computer scientists or programmers. It supports young people’s development as computational thinkers – individuals who can draw on computational concepts, practices, and perspectives in all aspects oftheir lives, across disciplines and contexts.

創意計算與計算有關。從事計算工件的創建，不僅為計算機科學家或程序員的職業生涯做好準備，還為年輕人做準備。它支持年輕人作為計算思想者的發展 - 個人可以在他們的生活的所有方面，跨學科和上下文中利用計算概念，實踐和觀點。

## WHAT IS SCRATCH ?

There are many different tools that can be used for creative computing. In this guide, we use Scratch, which is a free computer programming language available at http://scratch.mit.edu. With Scratch, people can create a wide variety of interactive media projects – animations, stories, games, and more – and share those projects with others in an online community. Since Scratch’s launch in May 2007, hundreds of thousands of people all around the world have created and shared more than 6 million projects.

有許多不同的工具可用於創意計算。在本指南中，我們使用Scratch，這是一種免費的計算機編程語言，可在http://scratch.mit.edu上找到。通過Scratch，人們可以創建各種各樣的互動媒體項目 - 動畫，故事，遊戲等等，並與在線社區中的其他人分享這些項目。自從2007年5月Scratch推出以來，全球已有數十萬人創建並共享了超過600萬個項目。

## WHAT IS THIS GUIDE ?

This guide is a collection of ideas, strategies, and activities for an introductory creative computing experience using the Scratch programming language. The activities are designed to support familiarity and increasing fluency with computational creativity and computational thinking. In particular, the activities encourage exploration of key computational thinking concepts (sequence, loops, parallelism, events, conditionals, operators, data) and key computational thinking practices (experimenting and iterating, testing and debugging, reusing and remixing, abstracting and modularizing). Learn more about computational thinking – what it is and how to assess its development in learners – from resources in the appendix or by visiting <http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/ct> Inspired by constructionist approaches to learning, the activities in this guide emphasize the following principles:

本指南匯集了有關使用Scratch編程語言進行初步創意計算體驗的想法，策略和活動。這些活動旨在通過計算創造力和計算思維來支持熟悉度和提高流暢度。特別是，這些活動鼓勵探索關鍵計算思維概念（順序，循環，並行，事件，條件，操作符，數據）和關鍵計算思維實踐（實驗和迭代，測試和調試，重用和混合，抽象和模塊化）。通過附錄中的資源或訪問 http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/ct 了解更多關於計算思維 - 它是什麼以及如何評估其在學習者中的發展情況？通過建構主義學習方法的啟發，指南強調以下原則：

### PRINCIPLE #1:CREATING

Offer opportunities for learners to engage in designing and making, not just listening, observing, and using.

為學習者提供參與設計和製作的機會，而不僅僅是傾聽，觀察和使用。

### PRINCIPLE #2:PERSONALIZING

Offer opportunities for learners to engage in activities that are personally meaningful and relevant.

為學習者提供機會讓他們參與具有個人意義和相關性的活動。

### PRINCIPLE #3: SHARING

Offer opportunities for learners to engage in interactions with others as audience, coaches, and cocreators.

為學習者提供機會讓他們參與與觀眾，教練和共同創作者之間的互動。

### PRINCIPLE #4: REFLECTING

Offer opportunities for learners to review and rethink their creative practices.

為學員提供審查和重新思考其創作實踐的機會。

## WHO IS THIS GUIDE FOR ?

No matter your current context or prior experience, this guide was designed with a wide range of learners and educators in mind. Here are a few examples of who might use the guide and how they might use it:

無論您目前的環境或以往的經驗如何，本指南都是為廣泛的學習者和教育者而設計的。以下是誰可以使用指南以及他們如何使用指南的幾個示例：

### K-12 TEACHER

Scratch is being used in thousands of elementary, middle-school, and high-school classrooms around the world. The guide can be used in its entirety as a semester-long computing course, or selectively as part of other curricular areas. Many educators introduce creative computing as an after-school or lunch-time program, using the activities as inspiration and scaffolding for students’ open-ended explorations.

世界各地成千上萬的小學，初中和高中教室正在使用Scratch。該指南可以整體用作一學期的計算課程，或有選擇地將其作為其他課程領域的一部分。許多教育工作者將創意計算作為課後或午餐時間計劃，將活動作為靈感和腳手架，用於學生的開放式探索。    

### MUSEUM OR LIBRARY EDUCATOR

In addition to formal learning environments like classrooms, Scratch has been used in informal learning spaces like museums and libraries. Whether as a structured workshop experience or a drop-in play space, these learning environments are ideal for supporting explorations in creative computing, without some of the restrictions present in traditional settings.

除了像教室這樣的正式學習環境，Scratch還被用於非正式的學習空間，如博物館和圖書館。無論是作為一個結構化的研討會經驗還是作為一個遊戲空間，這些學習環境都非常適合支持創意計算的探索，而不受傳統環境中的限制。    

### PARENT

Parents can use the guide in a wide range of ways. From supporting homeschooling activities, to starting creative computing clubs at school, to hosting workshops at local community centers, parents are encouraged to think about how to use the guide to support the creative computing experiences of young learners.

家長可以通過各種方式使用指南。從支持在家自學活動到在學校開設創意計算俱樂部，到在當地社區中心舉辦研討會，都鼓勵家長思考如何使用指南來支持年輕學習者的創造性計算體驗。    

### COLLEGE INSTRUCTOR

Scratch can serve as an introduction to fundamental computational concepts and practices, often followed by a transition to more traditional text-based programming languages in computer science courses. For example, the CS50 course at Harvard University uses Scratch as an introductory programming experience before transitioning to the C programming language. The activities have also been used as part of education, art, and media literacy courses at the college level.

Scratch可以作為基本計算概念和實踐的介紹，通常在計算機科學課程中轉換為更傳統的基於文本的編程語言。例如，哈佛大學的CS50課程在過渡到C編程語言之前使用Scratch作為入門編程經驗。這些活動也被用作大學層面的教育，藝術和媒體素養課程的一部分。    

### YOUNG LEARNER

Over the past seven years since Scratch’s launch, young learners have been passionate advocates for creative computing in a variety of settings. From introducing their parents and teachers to programming, to creating learning opportunities for their peers, creative computing can be something that is done with them or by them, rather than just for them.

自Scratch推出以來的七年中，年輕的學習者一直熱衷於在各種環境中進行創意計算。從介紹他們的父母和老師到編程，為他們的同齡人創造學習機會，創意計算可以由他們或他們完成，而不僅僅是為他們完成。

## WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS GUIDE?
This guide is organized in seven units – from an initial preparatory unit to a culminating projectbased unit – with each unit typically including six activities. A summary of each unit follows:

本指南分為七個單元 - 從初始準備單元到最終項目單元 - 每個單元通常包括六個活動。每個單位的摘要如下：    

### UNIT 0 – GETTING STARTED
Prepare for the culture of creative computing by exploring possibilities and setting up technical infrastructure (e.g., creating Scratch accounts, starting design journals) and social infrastructure (e.g., establishing critique groups). Dive into an initial creative experience by making UNIT 0 – GETTING STARTED something “surprising” happen to a Scratch character.

通過探索可能性和建立技術基礎設施（例如創建Scratch賬戶，創建設計期刊）和社會基礎設施（例如建立批評組）來準備創意計算文化。通過使UNIT 0 - GETTING STARTED在Scratch角色中發生某些“令人驚訝”的事情，潛入初始創意體驗中。    

### UNIT 1 - EXPLORING
Get comfortable with the key computational concept of sequence through a series of activities that provide varying levels of structure – from a step-by-step tutorial, to a creative challenge using a limited number of blocks, to open-ended explorations through making a project about yourself.

通過一系列提供不同級別結構的活動來獲取序列的關鍵計算概念 - 從循序漸進的教程到使用有限數量的塊的創造性挑戰，通過製作項目進行開放式探索關於你自己。    

### UNIT 2 - ANIMATIONS
Play with visuals and audio in these activities focused on animation, art, and music. Explore Scratch’s focus on media – and the key computational concepts of loops, events, and parallelism – by building your own band, designing animated creatures, and creating a music video for a favorite song.

在這些以動畫，藝術和音樂為重點的活動中播放視覺和音頻。探索Scratch對媒體的關注 - 以及循環，事件和並行的關鍵計算概念 - 通過構建自己的樂隊，設計動畫生物以及為最喜歡的歌曲創建音樂視頻。    

### UNIT 3 - STORIES
Create new interactive worlds through collaborative storytelling. Begin by developing characters, learning to code conversations, and then situating those characters and conversations in shifting scenes. Combine characters, conversations, and scenes in a larger story project that is passed along to other creators to further develop – and possibly reimagine entirely!

通過協作講故事創建新的互動世界。首先開發角色，學習編碼對話，然後將這些角色和談話置於場景中。將角色，對話和場景結合在一個更大的故事項目中，傳遞給其他創作者以進一步發展 - 並且可能完全重新構想！    

### UNIT 4 - GAMES
Connect fundamental game mechanics such as score and levels to key computational concepts, such as variables, operators, and conditionals. Analyze your favorite games, imagine new ones, and practice game design by implementing (and extending) classic games, like Pong.

將基本的遊戲機制（如分數和級別）連接到關鍵的計算概念，如變量，運算符和條件。分析你最喜歡的遊戲，想像新的遊戲，並通過實施（和擴展）經典遊戲，如Pong來練習遊戲設計。    

### UNIT 5 – DIVING DEEPER
Before the culminating unit, take a moment to revisit work from prior units, further exploring advanced concepts or helping others by designing new activities or debugging challenges.

在最終單位之前，花點時間重新審視以前單位的工作，進一步探索先進理念或通過設計新活動或調試挑戰來幫助他人。    

### UNIT 6 - HACKATHON
Put all of the computational concepts and practices into action by designing and developing a project of your own through iterative cycles of planning, making, and sharing.

通過設計和開發您自己的項目，通過計劃，製作和共享的迭代循環，將所有計算概念和實踐付諸行動。    
*Assessment strategies are described throughout the guide, and several assessment instruments are included in the guide appendix. Our approach to assessment is process-oriented, with a focus on creating opportunities for students to talk about their own (and others’) creations and creative practices. There are many forms of process-oriented data that could be collected and various strategies are suggested throughout the guide, such as:

*整個指南描述了評估策略，指南附錄中包含了一些評估工具。我們的評估方法是面向過程的，重點是為學生提供談論他們自己（和其他人）創作和創意實踐的機會。在整個指南中可以收集許多形式的面向過程的數據並提出各種策略，例如：     

+ supporting conversations with and among students about their projects, recorded through audio, video, or text
+ examining portfolios of projects
+ maintaining design journals  
  We view assessment as something that is done with students, to support their understanding of what they already know and what they still want to learn. Assessment can involve a variety of participants, including the creators, their peers, teachers, parents, and others. 
+ 通過音頻，視頻或文本記錄與學生就項目進行交談的內容
+ 檢查項目組合
+ 維護設計期刊我們將評估視為與學生一起完成的事情，以支持他們理解他們已經知道的內容以及他們仍然想要學習的內容。 評估可以涉及各種參與者，包括創作者，他們的同伴，教師，父母和其他人。
